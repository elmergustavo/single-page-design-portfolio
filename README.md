## My process

1. Download starter files
2. Download design files
3. Export design files into svg format and open them using a web browser
4. Develop the web page on desktop view from top to bottom using the exported svg's as guidance
5. Adjust the design on tablet and mobile view
6. When the design layout is finished, start working on the functionality
7. Review, deploy and publish the final result

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### Continued development

During this project I have mainly focused on the design and functionality, leaving out essential accessibility aspects. Moving forward I plan on working towards developing more accessible applications.
